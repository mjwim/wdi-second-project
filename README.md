## Wine and Cheese Pairing

###Why this project

Like many people, I enjoy wine and cheese and wanted to make something that made it easy to see and pair up combinations that people like. I also wanted to make my app useful for those with limited knowledge to see the wines and cheeses that can be paired with comments
