## Wine and Cheese Pairing

###Why Wine and Cheese

Like many people, I enjoy wine and cheese and wanted to make something that made it easy to see and pair up combinations that people like. I also wanted to make my app useful for those with limited knowledge to see the wines and cheeses that can be paired with comments.

## How to use Wine and Cheese Pairing

Wine and Cheese app is a fully RESTful web app with a front and back end and authentication. Its purpose is to allow users to upload wines and cheeses separately, but pair any wine with any cheese separately. To achieve this I have built models for both wines and cheeses and then a further model for pairings.

I was really keen to make the pairing process as painless as possible for my users. To do this I built functionality where a user can selecting the relevant wine and cheese to be paired by using carousels and then create a pairing at the click of a button. It was a significant challenge but extremely rewarding to write the required JavaScript and jQuery to be able to provide this to my users.

## What would I improve given more time

* Improve styling
* Allow a user to make comments on individual wines and cheeses
* Build profile pages for individuals so they can see all their comments
